<h2>Bio stuff about the boy developing this app<h2>
<h5> Here are some bits and roughly drafted pieces of info about me.<h5>

	<h5>I don't expect anyone will really be reading this lol, but alas, the more I type and play the more I learn. This content will change as I actually build this app!<h5>

	<h5>By the way, if you are reading this you will learn things about me that it's likely I would never tell you in less we are close friends.<h5>

  <h5>I am a fierce believer that teaching, modeling and supporting resiliency is vital. Within community, people have the ability to cultivate resiliency within themselves. This ultimately has a profound and lasting impact on the trajectory of their lives. Take it from me – I am an orphan. I am undocumented. I have no family. I survived the chaos of foster care. I experienced homelessness. I experienced severe abuse in ways that would make most shudder because they utterly defy humanity.<h5> 
  <h5>But I am here. I am intact. I care deeply for others. I am protective. I love to learn and have fun. I will soar!<h5> 

	<h5>I survived because of resiliency; because of resourcefulness; because I’m a fighter; because I was lucky enough to have had people who were beacons of light in my life, that were enough to help me navigate in the dark. Because I am hungry for opportunity and connection and I fight for it. Because despite what I have endured I believe that people, the world and being alive is a gift!<h5> 

	<h5>I dream of going to college!! I have applied and was accepted to several great colleges. I received offers of generous scholarships but did not receive full-funding opportunities. I have one year of college credit with my credits from Duke University and Middlebury college. I have a 4.0 GPA. I don't know how I will ever afford to pay tuition. *See Langston Hughes about Dreams deferred...<h5> 

	<h5>I just turned 22 a month ago, but in many ways I am still just a boy, and in others I am an 85 year-old holocaust survivor. I do not use this word or appropriate it lightly. Ninety-seven members of my family were murdered in the Holocaust, the Shoah, so I take using the word very seriously. But that’s what I am--a holocaust survivor. My beautiful parents died when I was really little. I can still remember the smell of my mother's hair and the warmth of her love. I remember my dad putting me on his shoulders--I felt like a giant. I was put into an orphanage in northern Romania that was akin to a death-camp. I will not write about this orphanage here, right now. Maybe one day...  <h5>

	<h5>Just as one day I will write about how I was brought to the US. When it's safe to do so. 

  <h5>Once in the US, I found myself in the revolving door of children’s shelters, foster care placements and the street. The types of violence I experienced, let's just say boys are typically socialized not to talk about--I haven't yet found a way to transcend that destructive societal barrier.  After multiple moves and a staggering number of foster care placements, my life and hence my traditional education had been severely disrupted. While I didn’t have the stabilizing anchor of a secure home and a chance to stay enrolled in school—- neighborhood libraries became a bit of both for me. On a soggy morning in early November 2002 when I was 9-years-old, I was looking for a safe place to hide. What I discovered was a sanctuary that offered the briefest, yet most profound respite in an unimaginable nightmare. This gave me breathing room to ignite my curiosities. I could escape the violence, while opening a tangible window of hope and possibility. Libraries became the epicenter of where I could hold onto my dreams.<h5>

   <h5>In public and eventually college libraries I developed into a proficient home-schooler, building a comprehensive curriculum for myself. I read prolifically, studying a myriad of subjects including literature, philosophy, history, physics and biology. I was completely enchanted by Ondaatje’s prose and poetry, Foucault, Martin Buber’s I and Thou, and Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle.<h5> 


	<h5>I have always been fascinated by neuroscience and sports medicine. I am interested in the use of fMRI to determine the efficacy of treatment modalities for trauma. I am also keenly eager to study the relationship between sports, trauma and resiliency. I can go into this in more depth when I have more time. I want to study the neurobiology of resiliency and the impact of sports and play on that.<h5>

	<h5>Right now, I'm learning to code. It doesn't mean I don't want to pursue neuroscience. Just as being passionate about that doesn't make me less committed to learning to code. 
	Coding is awesome.<h5>

	<h4>I have survived some unspeakable experiences, but there is much more to me than these experiences. For a long list of starters, I am a resilient, highly curious and ambitious self-taught student, an autodidact, and I am now head-over-heels about learning to code. I’m excited at the prospect of learning and discovering new things across all disciplines, but hope to really focus on coding, neuroscience, sports medicine and learning new languages. I loves dogs, water sports, book inscriptions, Indian food, Michael Ondaatje’s “Coming Through Slaughter”, rugby, the Durham Bulls, candid photography, foreign films and hoodies. I am fiercely loyal. I have a fine, albeit wry sense of humor. I love to play, I constantly crave music, and I have a slight penchant for benign, good-natured mischief. In my next life, I hope to come back as an adored velvety-eared beagle.<h4>
