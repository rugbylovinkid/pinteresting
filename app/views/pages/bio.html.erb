<h1>Bio stuff about the boy developing this app<h1>
<h4> Here are some bits and roughly drafted pieces of info about me.<h4>

	<h4>I don't expect anyone will really be reading this lol, but alas, the more I type and play the more I am learning to code. This content will change as I actually build this app!<h4>

	<h4>By the way, if you are reading this you will learn things about me that it's likely I would never tell you in less we are close friends.<h4>

    <h4>I am a fierce believer that teaching, modeling and supporting resiliency through commitment and compassion is vital for a person to learn they have the ability to cultivate resiliency within themselves. This ultimately has a profound and lasting impact on the trajectory of their lives. Take it from me – I am an orphan. I am undocumented. I have no family. I survived the chaos of foster care, without even the rights and supports US citizen foster care children receive. I was homeless. I was abused in ways that would make you shudder because they utterly defy humanity.<h4> 
    <h4>But I am here.<h4> 
	<h4>Because of resiliency. Because of resourcefulness. Because I’m a fighter. Because despite what I have endured I believe that people, the world and being alive is a gift!<h4> 

	<h4>I dream of going to college. I applied and was accepted to several. I received offers of generous scholarships but did not receive full-funding opportunities.<h4> 

	<h4>I long for family. I have friends and friends are indeed, the family we choose. But I cannot deny that I long for family. I just turned 22, but in many ways I am still just a boy, and in others I am an 85 year-old holocaust survivor. I do not use this word or appropriate it lightly. 97 members of my family were murdered in the Holocaust, the Shoah, so believe me I take using the word very seriously. But that’s what I am. My family was taken and died. I was put into an orphanage in northern Romania that was akin to a death-camp. I will not write about this orphanage here. Right now, I need a big brother. Is that lame? I don’t think so. Everyone needs someone to have their back.<h4>

	<h4>I am deliberately skipping how I was brought to the US. I don't want to write it, even here.<h4>

    <h4>Once in the US, I found myself in the revolving door of children’s shelters, foster care placements and the street. After multiple moves and a staggering number of foster care placements, my life and hence my traditional education had been severely disrupted. While I didn’t have the stabilizing anchor of a secure home and a chance to stay enrolled in school—one day that ultimately transformed the rest of my life, was the morning I ended up on the doorstep of a neighborhood library; I was looking for a safe place to hide. What I discovered was a sanctuary that offered the briefest, yet most profound respite in an unimaginable nightmare. This gave me breathing room to ignite my curiosities. I could escape the violence, while opening a tangible window of hope and possibility. Libraries became the epicenter of where I could hold onto my dreams.<h4>

    <h4>In public and eventually college libraries I developed into a proficient home-schooler, building a comprehensive curriculum for myself. I read prolifically, studying a myriad of subjects including literature, philosophy, history, physics and biology. I was completely enchanted by Ondaatje’s prose and poetry, Foucault, Martin Buber’s I and Thou, and Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle.<h4> 


	<h4>I have always been fascinated by neuroscience and sports medicine. I am interested in the use of fMRI to determine the efficacy of treatment modalities for trauma. I am also keenly eager to study the relationship between sports, trauma and resiliency. This I can go into more when I have more time. Ultimately though, I believe play is critical to resiliency and playing sports can allow someone who didn't have choices over their body, to feel present and own their body again. I want to study the neurobiology of resiliency and the impact of sports and play on that.<h4>

	<h4>Right now, I'm learning to code. It doesn't mean I don't want to pursue neuroscience. Just as being passionate about that doesn't make me less committed to learning to code. 
	Coding is aan exciting option for me to grow and learn in new ways. If possible, it would be a really cool way to be self-supporting, intellectually growing and making my dreams come true.<h4>

	<h3>I have survived some unspeakable experiences, but there is much more to me than these experiences. For a long list of starters, I am a highly curious and ambitious self-taught student, an autodidact, and I am now head-over-heels about learning to code. I’m excited at the prospect of learning and discovering new things across all disciplines, but I hope to really focus in the future on coding, neuroscience, sports medicine and learning new languages. I loves dogs, all water sports, book inscriptions, curry, Michael Ondaatje’s “Coming Through Slaughter”, rugby (and most sports really) photography, foreign films and hoodies. I am fiercely loyal. I have a fine, albeit wry sense of humor. I love to play, I constantly crave music, and I have a slight penchant for benign, good-natured mischief. In my next life, I hope to come back as an adored velvety-eared beagle.<h3>
